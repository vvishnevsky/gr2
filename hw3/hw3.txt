Write a C# program to check two given integers and return true if one is negative and one is positive.
           Sample Output:
           Input first integer:
           -5
           Input second integer:
           25
           Check if one is negative and one is positive:
           True

- Write a C# program to check the sum of the two given integers and return true if one of the integer is 20 or if their sum is 20.
- Write a C# program to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99. Prints one number per line.
- Write a C# program to compute the sum of the first 500 prime numbers.
             Sample Output:
             Sum of the first 500 prime numbers:
             824693

- Write a C# program and compute the sum of the digits of an integer.
             Sample Output:
